	<h1>Prepare a server</h1>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>First, prepare the servers necessary for network updates.</p>
		<p>Free hosting servers, such as those used to set up personal websites, are acceptable.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>With hosting servers (especially with free services), network updates may be inconvenient due to restrictions or settings.</p>
		<p>Pay particular attention to the following points when choosing a server.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The required file extensions can be uploaded.
			<li>Ads are not automatically included in text files.
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>If you are looking for a free hosting server, the following pages should be helpful.</p>
		<p><a href="http://emily.shillest.net/specwiki/index.php?%E7%A5%9E%E5%A4%9C%E3%81%BF%E3%82%85%E3%82%93%2F%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E9%85%8D%E5%B8%83%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E3%81%AA%E3%82%89">The Daidebe wiki: where is the best place to distribute ghosts?

<section id="chapter2" class="ordered">
	<h1>Set update URL</h1>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>Generally, it is written in the <em class="filename">descript.txt</em> file.</p>
		<p>Write the following line in <em class="filename">descript.txt</em> to set it up.</p>
		<pre class="exmp-descript2"><code>homeurl,http://xxx.yyy/myghost/</code></pre>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>The url to be written here will be the url on the network to the folder containing the contents of the network update (the location where <em class="filename">updates2.dau</em> will be created later).</p>
		<p>Therefore, what the url will be depends on the server. But suppose the root directory of that server is http://xxx.yyy/, and the folder of the ghost for which you want to support network updates (myghost) is like so:</p>
<pre>
+-root
　　+-ukagaka
　　　　<em class="filename">+-myghost1</em>
　　　　　　<em class="filename">+-ghost</em>
　　　　　　<em class="filename">+-shell</em>
　　　　　　<em class="filename">+-readme.txt</em>
　　　　　　<em class="filename">+-updates2.dau</em>
+-index.html
+-hogehoge.html
+-style.css
:
:
</pre>
		<p>If the file is placed on a server with this arrangement, then the descript.txt file should contain the following information:</p>
		<pre class="exmp-descript2"><code>homeurl,http://xxx.yyy/ukagaka/myghost1/</code></pre>
		<!--<p>This is what you should write.</p>--> <!--Translator note: this isn't adding anything in English, I think -->
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>If the content is a ghost, it is possible not only to specify the url in <em class="filename">descript.txt</em>, but also with <a href="list_shiori_resource.html">SHIORI Resource</a>'s "<a href="list_shiori_resource.html#homeurl">homeurl</a>"</p>
		<p>The specific method of specifying homeurl using SHIORI Resource on the ghost side depends on the SHIORI, and is beyond the scope of this document. Please refer to the respective SHIORI documentation.</p>
	</div>
</section>
<section id="chapter3" class="ordered">
	<h1>Remove unnecessary files</h1>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>Next, remove the files that are unnecessary for the user. For example, files such as these.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Save data files for the various SHIORI and other applications (unless required to set initial values, etc.)</li>
			<li>All profile folders (can be in both ghost and shell, these are automatically removed in SSP)</li>
			<li>Development tools (such as Satorite, RESTHIBA, etc., which are included with Satorite)</li>
			<li>(MATERIA only) profile.txt directly under the directory</li>
			<li>Windows-generated configuration files such as desktop.ini (These are automatically removed to some extent in SSP)</li>
			<li>Other dictionary files for development, configuration files, log files, etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>In the case of SSP, <em class="filename">developer_options.txt</em> will be helpful if it is too much trouble to remove them manually every time.</p>
		<p>For more details, please read <a href="#chapterEX1">the explanation below</a>.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>However, what should we do if we have <em>released an update with these unnecessary files mixed in</em>, or if a file we used to use <em>becomes unnecessary (renamed)</em>?</p>
		<p>In such cases, <em>simply deleting unnecessary files from the server will not delete the user's files</em>.</p>
		<p>This is because network updates involve overwriting files on the user side with files on the server, not synchronizing (mirroring) them.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>To remove unnecessary files (that have already been distributed) during a network update, use <em class="filename">delete.txt</em>.</p>
		<p>The <em class="filename">delete.txt</em> file is placed in the top level folder of the contents of the network update (for example, in the case of a ghost, where the ghost folder, shell folder, <em class="filename">readme.txt</em>, etc., are located. For other types, it is where descript.txt is located).</p>
		<p>For a layout example, please see "<a href="manual_update.html">Network Updates</a>" in the File Structure section of the menu on the left side of the page.</p>

<section id="chapter4" class="ordered">
	<h1>Create updates2.dau</h1>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>Next, create a file for network updates (<em class="filename">updates2.dau</em>).</p>
		<p>This is a mechanism to detect anomalies such as corruption or falsification by checking for differences in file contents between the server side and the client side.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>To create <em class="filename">updates2.dau</em> in MATERIA or CROW, you need to create an empty text file named <em class="filename">updates2.dau</em> in the top directory (for example, where the ghost folder, shell folder, readme.txt, etc., are located for ghosts). You will need to create this file in advance.</p>
		<p>In SSP, it is created automatically.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>Then start the baseware<a href="#note1" class="note" id="note1-symbol">※</a> and drag and drop the folder containing <em class="filename">updates2.dau</em> and the files you want to update to the main unit.</p>
		<p>Note that in MATERIA and CROW, if <em class="filename">install.txt</em> is included in the files, the creation of the nar file is prioritized and <em class="filename">updates2.dau</em> will not be created. So, do not include it.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>After dragging and dropping the file, a file named <em class="filename">updates2.dau</em> should have been created in the folder, and something should be written inside it.</p>
		<p>You can open <em class="filename">updates2.dau</em> with a regular text editor such as Notepad by right clicking on it, and check the contents that way (you don't have to understand the contents themselves).</p>
	</div>
</section>
<section id="chapter5" class="ordered">
	<h1>Upload to server</h1>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>Once you have reached this point, all you need to do is upload the files to the sevrer using FTP or other communication software.</p>
		<p>However, please note that <em>all files must be uploaded in binary communication mode</em>.</p>
		<p>If you upload in ASCII mode, network updates will fail.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		For safety, you may wish to leave a "before network update" copy in your baseware and use it to confirm that the network update completes successfully after the upload is complete.
	</div>
</section>
<section id="chapterEX1" class="ordered ex">
	<h1>About developer_options.txt</h1>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>When creating an archive or <em class="filename">updates2.dau</em> with SSP, you can set which files should be targetted by creating a file named <em class="filename">developer_options.txt</em> at the top level (where install.txt is placed when creating an archive).</p>
		<p>See the <a href="descript_install.html#developer_options.txt">section on developer_options.txt on the Install/Update Settings page</a> for instructions and examples.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		Note that this file only works when creating archives and <em class="filename">updates2.dau</em> with SSP, and is not valid when creating them with other baseware, or the <a href="#chapterEX2">Ghost Distribution Automation System</a> described below.
	</div>
</section>
<section id="chapterEX2" class="ordered ex">
	<h1>About Ghost Distribution Automation System (GDM)</h1>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>The Ghost Distribution Automation System (GDM) is a support tool that handles creating <em class="filename">updates2.dau</em>, creating the ghost archive, and uploading it to the server all at once.</p>
		<p>Once installed and properly set up, most of what is written on this page will be unnecessary.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>It is currently distributed by the "Maintenance Team", listed below.</p>
		<p><a href="http://ms.shillest.net/#TOOL">Ghost Distribution Automation System</a></p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>Please also refer to the following site for detailed introduction and setup explanations (the contents of "1" are not necessary).</p>
		<p><a href="http://navy.nm.land.to/post/jidouhaihu.html">How to use the Ghost Distribution Automation System (GDM)</a></p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>Despite "ghost" being in the name, it can actually be used to upload archives and network update files for shells, balloons, and just about anything else.</p>
		<p>You can also save settings for multiple targets (Ghost 1, Ghost 2, Shell 1, Shell 2, Shell 3, Balloon, etc.) for each operation, such as archive creation, network update, etc. You can select just the operations you want to perform at that time and execute them all at once.</p>
		<p>This is very helpful if you are managing a lot of content.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>The initial installation and setup are a bit difficult, but once you've done it, it is very easy to complete network update and archive updates for multiple items with a single click.</p>
		<p>Not only that, it completely prevents md5 mismatch errors caused by mistakes such as modifying files after creating <em class="filename">updates2.dau</em>, or uploading with FTP communication set to ASCII mode.</p>
		<p>Of course, proper settings can also be of great help in preventing unwanted files from being mixed in.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>Note that the <a href="#chapterEX1">developer_options.txt</a> file mentioned above is a configuration file that works when creating nar and <em class="filename">updates2.dau</em> through SSP's function, so it is not relevant when creating them through GDM.<p>
		<p>However, GDM itself allows you to configure which files should be uploaded or not, so it is essentially unnecessary.</p>
	</div>
</section>
<section id="chapterEX3" class="ordered ex">
	<h1>About cases where ".dau" is rejected by the server</h1>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>Depending on the configuration of your hosting server, it may not handle files with the unfamiliar ".dau" extension.</p>
		<p>In such cases, <em class="filename">updates.txt</em> can be substituted.</p>
		<p>For usage, replace all "<em class="filename">updates2.dau</em>" on this page with "<em class="filename">updates.txt</em>".</p>
