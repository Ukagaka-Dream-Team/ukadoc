	<h1>Prepare an image</h1>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>First, prepare an image to be displayed on the desktop.</p>
		<p>You can either draw your own image, or use a ready-made shell that has been distributed, called a freeshell.</p>
	</div>
	<aside class="passage hint">
		<p>Freeshells can be found at the following site:</p>
		<p><a href="http://wikiwiki.jp/feeshell/">freeshell wiki</a></p>

	<div class="passage">
		<p>The default image format for ghosts is png.</p>
		<p>jpg, bmp, etc., cannot be used (except in SSP).</p>
		<p>If png is used, there are no restrictions on size or the number of colors, but transparency is invalid. (In SSP only, it can be enabled depending on the settings. See below section <a href="#chapterEX1">About translucent surfaces</a>).</p>
		<p>If you want to reduce file size, use a tool to optimize the color.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>Each of the images that make up the shell, as well as each frame of animation as described below, is managed as a unit called a <em>surface</em>.</p>
		<p>Surfaces can be created by preparing an image named "surface*.png" (where the "*" part is a number greater than or equal to 0), or by combining multiple images in <a href="#chapter5">surfaces.txt</a> as described below.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p><em class="filename">surface0.png</em> and <em class="filename">surface10.png</em> are mandatory for basic use.</p>
		<p><em class="filename">surface0.png</em> is the basic surface for the main character side, and <em class="filename">surface10.png</em> is the basic surface for the partner character side.</p>
		<p>Even if you only have one character as a ghost and do not need a partner character, please prepare a single-color, filled-in image (which will be displayed completely as transparency, see below) as <em class="filename">surface10.png</em></p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>Surfaces can be written as <em class="filename">surface0000.png</em>, <em class="filename">surface0010.png</em>, etc., and will be recognized as <em class="filename">surface0.png</em>, <em class="filename">surface10.png</em>, etc.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>In the surface image, the pixel at the upper left corner is displayed as a "transparency color".</p>
		<p>If the same color as the transparency color is also in the character, that area will also be transparent, so use a color that is not used in the character for the transparency color.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>If you prepare your own images to be used as surfaces, one feature to be aware of is the handling of outlines.</p>

	<h1>Write descript.txt</h1>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>The file <em class="filename">descript.txt</em> is used to set up basic information about the shell.</p>
		<p>If the <em class="filename">descript.txt</em> is not prepared properly, the shell will not be recognized by the ghost.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>For now, copy and paste the following into a text file named <em class="filename">descript.txt</em> and rewrite it as appropriate for your shell.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
<pre class="exmp-descript">
charset,UTF-8
type,shell
name,Name of this shell

craftman,Name of the author (please write in alphanumeric characters only)
craftmanw,Name of the author (can be written in any characters)
craftmanurl,URL of the author (e.g., distribution site URL)

		<p>In basically all cases, the charset should be UTF-8.

	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>As an example, to change the default balloon position for the entire shell, you will have to add the following items:</p>
<pre class="exmp-descript">
sakura.balloon.offsetx,0
sakura.balloon.offsety,0
kero.balloon.offsetx,0
kero.balloon.offsety,0
</pre>
		<p>sakura.balloon.offset changes the balloon position on the main character's side, and kero.balloon.offset changes the balloon position on the side character's side.</p>
		<p>If you increase the number, higher X coordinates will display the balloon closer to the character, and higher Y coordinates will display lower.</p>
		<p>Adding a minus symbol reverses the display position, so that negative X values are displayed further away from the character, and negative Y values are displayed higher up.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="passage">
		<p>If you would like to display the menu with the dressup items, you must also put the description of these in the <em class="filename">descript.txt</em> file, but please see the page on <a href="dev_bind.html">setting up dressups</a> for an explanation of how to do this.</p>

			<pre class="exmp-descript">animation0.interval,sometimes</pre>
			<p>The line that starts with animation*.interval defines when the animation with that number will be executed.</p>
			<p>The number after the word "animation" is the ID of the animation definition (the timing settings (interval), and subsequent "frame" settings (pattern, etc.))</p>
			<p>Animation IDs can be any number and do not have to be sequential, but it is expected that <em>animations with the same meaning will be given the same ID</em><a href="#note1" class="note" id="note1-symbol">※</a>.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="passage">
			<p>The "sometimes" following animation0.interval is the content of the interval definition.</p>
			<p>If sometimes is specified, as in the example, the animation will run on its own occasionally (With a chance of 1/2 per second).</p>
			<p>In other words, you are specifying something like "the animation with ID 0 sometimes runs on its own".</p>
			<p>See the <a href="descript_shell_surfaces.html#sometimes"> section on animation intervals</a> in "Shell Settings - surfaces.txt" for what other timing specifications are available.</p>

			<p>The 100 part means that surface100 is what is drawn in this frame.</p>
			<p>Basically, you can think of it as <em class="filename">surface100.png</em>.</p>
			<p>If you specify 101, <em class="filename">surface101.png</em> is used.</p>

			<p>For example, suppose a character has a front-facing pose, surface0, and a side-facing pose, surface5, and we want to do a "blink" animation for both of them.</p>
			<p>In this case, in addition to defining the blinking on surface0 as seen in the above example, you will also make a similar definition on surface5. But since there is a difference between the angle for front-facing and side-facing poses, the surfaces (images) used as frames should be different.</p>
			<p>However, since both are "blinks" and are treated in the same way, it would be desirable to use the same animation ID for both (e.g., 0).</p>

		<h1>Write surfaces.txt - element synthesis section</h1>
		<div class="passage">
			<p>element is a mechanism for combining images made of multiple parts and treating them as a single surface.</p>
			<p>For example, if all surfaces must be prepared as images such as surface0.png, then if you want to add more facial expressions to a character, you must prepare as many full-body images as there are facial expressions, even if the only difference is a slightly different mouth shape.</p>
			<p>However, if it is possible to separate body parts and facial expression parts and composite them, then even if you want to add more facial expressions you will only need to prepare images with the different facial expressions. Thus, the overall shell size will be reduced considerably.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, if the eye and mouth parts are separated, you can create expressions by combining different eyes and mouths without having to draw the full expression itself.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="passage">
			<p>The following is an example of an element definition.</p>
<pre class="exmp-descript2">
surface1

<em>element0,overlay,body0.png,0,0</em>
<em>element1,overlay,face1.png,0,0</em>

			<pre class="exmp-descript2">element<em>0</em>,overlay,body0.png,0,0</pre>

			<p>IDs are sequential numbers starting from 0. The smaller the number, the lower (at the back of the screen) the part to be composited.</p>

			<p>The keyword that follows is the drawing method.</p>

			<h1><a href="#note2-symbol">※2</a></h1>
			<p>Consider, for example, a web service such as a ghost database, where you want to display a preview of the ghost.</p>
			<p><a href="#chapter1" title="Prepare an image">As mentioned earlier</a>, surface0 and surface10 are considered basic surfaces and basically cannot be omitted.</p>
			<p>In other words, surfaces 0 and 10 are always considered to be present, so it is convenient to use them for preview.</p>
			<p>However, if surfaces 0 and 10 are composed by element compositing, the previewer would have to read the element definitions and composite them as intended.</p>
			<p>This poses some hurdles not only for human-powered systems, but also for systems that are automated by programs.</p>
			<p>Therefore, when considering the use of such services, it may be better to prepare surfaces 0 and 10 as actual pngs.</p>

		<p>Translucent areas are clickable as part of the character.</p>
		<p>Therefore, transparent areas should be completely black (RGB=0,0,0).</p>

		<p>In the case of SSP, you can create a <em class="filename">surface*.png</em> as a PNG with an alpha channel and use that alpha channel as the transparency, without using pna.</p>
		<p>In that case, the following statement must be added to the <em class="filename">descript.txt</em> file:</p>
		<pre class="exmp-descript">seriko.use_self_alpha,1</pre>
		<p>For details on how to create a PNG with an alpha channel, please refer to the instructions for various painting software (some software may not be able to handle it. Try searching for keywords such as PNG, 32bitPNG, αPNG, etc.).</p>
